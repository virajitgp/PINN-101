# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

This project demonstrates the use of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE). The PINN is compared to a standard neural network (NN) to highlight the differences in their solutions.

## What are PINNs?

Physics-Informed Neural Networks are a type of neural network that incorporates knowledge of physical laws into the learning process. This is achieved by adding a term to the loss function that penalizes the network for not satisfying the underlying differential equation. This allows PINNs to be trained with less data than traditional NNs and to produce solutions that are more physically plausible.

### How they work

A PINN is trained to minimize a loss function that consists of two parts:

1.  **Data Loss:** This is the standard mean squared error loss between the network's output and the training data.
2.  **Physics Loss:** This term measures how well the network's output satisfies the underlying differential equation. It is calculated by taking the derivative of the network's output with respect to its input and substituting it into the differential equation.

The total loss is a weighted sum of the data loss and the physics loss. By minimizing this total loss, the PINN learns to satisfy both the training data and the physical laws.

## The Problem

This project solves the following ordinary differential equation:

```
du/dx = 2*cos(2x)
```

with the boundary condition:

```
u(0) = 0
```

The true solution to this problem is:

```
u(x) = sin(2x)
```

## The Code

The Python script `pinn.py` implements the following:

1.  A neural network is defined using PyTorch.
2.  A physics-informed loss function is defined that incorporates the ODE.
3.  The PINN is trained using the Adam optimizer.
4.  A standard neural network is trained on the same data for comparison.
5.  The solutions from the PINN, the standard NN, and the true solution are plotted.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pinn-project.git
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install torch numpy matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python pinn.py
    ```

This will generate a plot `pinn_vs_nn_solution.png` that shows the comparison between the PINN and NN solutions.

## Results

The plot generated by the script shows that the PINN solution is much closer to the true solution than the standard NN solution. This is because the PINN is able to leverage the information from the differential equation to guide its learning process.
